# Roo ConPort Modes v2 - Project Brief

## Project Overview

**roo-conport-modes-v2** is a mode development framework for the roo coding agent that solves the "smart worker with Alzheimer's" problem through mandatory ConPort integration. This project implements a dual-track versioning system where human-readable source specifications drive AI-generated modes, with comprehensive knowledge preservation across development sessions.

## Core Purpose

Establish a **meta-development system** that provides:
- Persistent AI memory across sessions through mandatory ConPort integration
- Multi-file human/AI-readable mode specifications with semantic behavior transmission
- Dual-track versioning: filesystem for humans, ConPort for AI metadata
- Automatic knowledge preservation with real-time logging via MCP server
- Horizontal version expansion with source/binary separation concepts

## Project Scope

### Primary Components

1. **Dual-Track Version Management System**
   - Multi-file mode specifications (purpose, algorithms, anti-patterns, tests, scope-specific knowledge)
   - Horizontal version expansion with complete specification sets per version
   - Filesystem-based human access with Git tracking
   - ConPort-based AI metadata storage with behavioral vectors

2. **ConPort-Filesystem Integration Bridge**
   - Automatic logging of filesystem changes via ConPort MCP server
   - Real-time synchronization between file operations and knowledge management
   - Scoped history files for selective context loading
   - Bidirectional linking between filesystem versions and ConPort entries

3. **AI-Enhanced Testing Framework**
   - Hybrid behavior/artifact testing with conventional and AI-driven quality assurance
   - Statistical approach to AI test results with adaptive scope management
   - Live testing through existing MCP server/CLI integration
   - Change impact tracking with conflict resolution procedures

4. **Mode Development Meta-System**
   - Local project mode for creating and maintaining other modes
   - Semantic extraction for cross-mode idea sharing
   - Non-executable programming language concepts for deterministic AI behavior
   - Template-driven mode creation with guided development workflows

## Key Principles

### Integration Architecture
- **Roo-Centric with ConPort Enhancement**: No system without roo extension, ConPort provides exponential workflow enhancement
- **Mandatory ConPort Integration**: All development decisions and progress flow through ConPort in real-time
- **Context Preservation**: Prevents task regression and forgotten progress across chat sessions

### Version Management Philosophy
- **Source vs Binary Separation**: Specification files are diffable source code, generated modes are conceptual binaries
- **Horizontal Expansion**: Each version gets complete directory with preserved change tracking
- **Scoped History**: Multiple selective history files instead of monolithic history loading

### Knowledge Management Strategy
- **Real-Time Logging**: Automatic ConPort updates via scripts with rich metadata (confidence, purpose, risk assessment)
- **Semantic Extraction**: Cross-mode idea generation without direct composition complexity
- **Mandatory Discovery/Categorization**: Context preservation through systematic organization
